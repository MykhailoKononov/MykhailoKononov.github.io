Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I’m Mykhailo Kononov, a passionate Python developer with over two years of hands-on experience building data-driven applications, dynamic websites, and automation tools. Here, you’ll find highlights of my journey, projects I’ve poured my heart into, and the technologies I love working with.

## About Me
------
I’m a graduate in Computer Science with a passion for transforming data into meaningful insights. My career began in data analysis, where I learned to clean, visualize, and interpret complex datasets. Eager to impact end users more directly, I transitioned to backend development. Today, I design and implement robust APIs, automate workflows, and craft data pipelines that support critical business processes. Collaboration and clear communication are at the core of how I work—whether I’m presenting a Power BI dashboard to stakeholders or reviewing pull requests with teammates.
- **Education**: BSc in Computer Science

- **Experience Path**: Data Analyst → Backend Developer (Django, Flask, FastAPI)

- **Core Focus**: Automation, scalable APIs, ETL pipeline design

## Philosophy
------

1. **Readable Code**: I write code as if the next person to read it is a colleague with tight deadlines. Clear naming, concise functions, and inline documentation are my standards.

2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Every feature, optimization, or report begins by asking: “What do the numbers tell us?” I rely on metrics and analysis to guide development roadmaps.

3. **Growth Mindset**: Technology never stands still. I dedicate time each week to learning new tools, exploring best practices, and experimenting with side projects to stay ahead of the curve.

4. **User-Centric Development**: Software exists to serve people. I balance performance, accessibility, and user experience to deliver solutions that are both powerful and intuitive.
